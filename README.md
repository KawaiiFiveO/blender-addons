# Blender Add-ons

Add-ons for Blender, developed for version 4.2 LTS. May work with other versions.

### Material Cleanup Tool

When exporting `.fbx` files with certain types of materials, the exported file does not contain the image textures.

Upon re-importing the asset (after it has been processed by Mixamo, etc.), it will be missing its textures and you will need to manually re-apply the original material on each part of the asset.

This tool adds a button to automate this process.
